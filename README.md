# VBA of Wall Street

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The green wave is among us. Renewable energy has made significant strides with the advancing technology and the magnification of an environmentally conscious populace. Steve wants to capitalize on the bullish outlook of stocks related to green energy for the potential gains and his desire to join the movement towards a more sustainable future. With his vision of sustainability in mind, we will be analyzing a variety of green energy stocks for potential investment opportunities for Steve and his family. We will be using VBA in excel to automate our analysis so the end-user,i.e., Steve, can run complex analyses while mitigating errors, all with the press of a button. The future has never looked so bright and green! Perhaps there is a lucrative solar company that has what it takes to catch all that bright light.
